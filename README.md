# Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Detection

Repository for the outcome predictions of patients with SAH. 

### Overview

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is bleeding into the subarachnoid space- the area between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain. Symptoms may include a severe headache of rapid onset, vomiting, decreased level of consciousness, fever and sometimes seizures. Neck stiffness or neck pain are also relatively common. In about a quarter of people a small bleed with resolving symptoms occur within a month of a larger bleed.

There are several grading scales available for SAH. The Glasgow Outcome Scale is used as an international standard for assessing patient outcomes after 90 days of discharge from the hospital.
